Emergent behaviour driven Learning

##1. Introduction
This is a simulation that uses Reaction-Diffusion to study emergent properties of 2d space + time dynamical systems.

Our aim is to build an emergent system that is able to learn given a reward, inputs and outputs, without an external algorithm that acts as a supervisor or an optimizer.

For make it learn, we think to follow the way of Cortical Labs but in a simulated environment rather than biological, but we are still in the early stages of development.

##Other information
The simulation is still in development phase.
